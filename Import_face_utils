Features
Face Detection
By creating an object of the face detection model you want you can use it to detect the faces in images.
I have also implemented outputs forms such as 1 : (x,y,w,h) and 2 : (top,right,bottom,left )

Face cropping
ability to crop the face from the image given the detector result
You can also zoom in and out from the face.

Example
import cv2
from face_utils.detection import Detector
from face_utils.cropping import cropping
imgPath = "files/Obama.jpg"
img = cv2.imread(imgPath)
img= np.array(img)
model = Detector("hog")
bbox = model.detect(img,2) #using (x,y,w,h) return mode
face = cropping.crop(img,bbox,1,80,80)
